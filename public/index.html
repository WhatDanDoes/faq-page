      <li>Dan, what do you do?
        <p>
          Great question! Thanks for asking...
        </p>
        <p>
          Most people know me as a <a href="https://wycliffe.ca">Wycliffe Bible Translator</a>.
          I am seconded to an organization called <a href="https://sil.org">SIL International</a>
          for whom I write translation software for the World Wide Web.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>What is SIL International?
        <p>
          Broadly speaking, we are interested in developing and preserving minority languages.
          Arguably, we are most famous for devising <em>alphabets</em> for languages that cannot
          be written down. SIL has been operating since 1933.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>How many language are there?
        <p>
          It depends on <a href="https://www.ethnologue.com/">who you ask</a>, but it is generally agreed that there are about 7,000
          living languages spoken today. Of those, it is likely that around 3,000 have no written form.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>That's super cool!
        <p>
          Well, that's not a question, but yes, it is something I hear frequently.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Can I get involved?
        <p>
          Absolutely!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are called to serve in this capacity, SIL and Wycliffe are always recruiting.
